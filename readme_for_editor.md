Specific Info for person looking to edit code:

I used a blank android template to build the interface on top of.
To make changes to the interface, edit the app/res/layout/activity_main,activity_main.xml(land) file.
The functional code that I hace written to make the backend work is found in app/java/com.example.bogiebuddy/MainActivity
All permissions must be granted in app/manifests/AndroidManidest.xml
